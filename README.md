access to care such that they may walk into any free medical clinic, homeless shelter or soup kitchen and enter the
user's information including any medical conditions they might be experiencing. The application makes use of a
naturl language processor to match keywords and provides them to the nearest shelters, clinics, and soup kitchens
that may address any needs they have. '
